# INFRASTRUCTURE - Azure Local SSD

Special for Azure D# instances, these instances are equiped with a local SSD
drive. This local SSD drive needs to be mounted to be used by Docker and
Kubernetes.

The local SSD drive offers a huge performance boost, compared to attached
disks. The internal SSD is not limited on IO and throughput. See the
[D-Series Performance
Expectations](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/06/d-series-performance-expectations/)
blog post for more information about the Azure Standard D1 performance.

Second we use OverlayFS, as compared to BTFRS for Docker. Which also provides
us with a huge performance boost. See the blog post [Overview Storage
Scalability
Docker](http://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/09/30/overview-storage-scalability-docker/)
for more information.

## Deployment

We deploy the Azure Standard D1 host with the following `#cloud-config`. First
the tmp drive `/dev/sdb` is unmounted, wiped, formatted as `ext4`. Second it is
mounted as docker storage `/var/lib/docker`.

```yaml

#cloud-config

coreos:
  units:
